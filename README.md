# The Evolution of Social Coding

The way we code today has become very social. It’s centred around
conversations and in many cases it’s based around a Web interface.
This move to a Web interface has resulted in projects relying on a
centralised version control model, even though most of us are now
using distributed version control systems. In this session long time
version control lover Emma Jane will rant furiously about why the
way we code today is risky, and what we can (and should) do about
it.
